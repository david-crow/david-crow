                I'm seeking employment as a software engineer in Seattle,
                Washington. Currently, I work as a Cyberspace Operations Officer
                for the US Air Force; I'll leave this role in August 2023.

                <p>
                    Hello! I'm David. I enjoy solving problems and building
                    things. Currently, I work for the US Air Force. In my role,
                    I lead red team engagements, conduct penetration tests, and
                    develop offensive cybersecurity tools.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Although I work in cybersecurity right now, my background is
                    in software engineering. I studied Computer Science for both
                    my Bachelor's and my Master's; throughout my studies and my
                    internships, I most enjoyed writing code. In my free time, I
                    like to solve programming challenges, like those from Advent
                    of Code or Project Euler, and construct various pieces of
                    software.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I'm proud of my time in the Air Force, but I'm also ready
                    for the next step of my career.
