        <h1>I like to build things.</h1>
        <p id="mission-statement">
            I'm seeking employment as a software engineer in Seattle,
            Washington, beginning October, 2023. For now, I work as a Cyberspace Operations Officer
            for the US Air Force.

            <div id="about-text">
                <p>Hello! I'm David. I enjoy solving problems and building things. Currently, I work for the US Air
                    Force. In my role, I lead red team engagements, conduct penetration tests, and develop offensive
                    cybersecurity tools.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Although I work in cybersecurity right now, my background is in software engineering. I studied
                    Computer Science for both my <a href="https://www.mst.edu">Bachelor's</a> and my <a
                        href="https://www.afit.edu">Master's</a>; throughout my studies and my internships (in
                    <a href="https://www.cerner.com/">healthcare</a> and in <a
                        href="https://www.garmin.com/">technology</a>), I
                    most enjoyed writing code.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I'm proud of my time in the Air Force, but I'm also ready for the next step of my career. To that
                    end, I spend my free time solving programming challenges, like those from <a
                        href="https://adventofcode.com/">Advent of Code</a> and <a
                        href="https://projecteuler.net/">Project Euler</a>, and building software, like this website and
                    some of <a href="https://github.com/david-crow">my other projects</a>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Recently, I've been working with the following technologies:
